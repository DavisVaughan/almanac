## 0.1.0 Resubmission

### Review 1 - 2020-05-21

> Please only double quote publication titles in the description of the
DESCRIPTION file. --> like the first Monday of December.

I have fixed this in the DESCRIPTION file.

> If there are references describing (the theoretical backgrounds of) the
methods in your package, please add these in the description field of
your DESCRIPTION file

There are no references that I would like to include.

> Examples/code lines in examples should never be commented out.
Ideally find toy examples that can be regularly executed and checked.
Lengthy examples (> 5 sec), can be wrapped in \donttest{}. If you don't
want your code to be executed but still visible to the user, use \dontrun{}.

I have removed the commented out code examples.

## 0.1.0 Submission

There are no references that I would like to include.
