\title{Create a new set-based recurrence bundle}
\usage{
rintersect()

runion()
}
\value{
An empty rbundle.
}
\description{
Often, a single rrule will be sufficient. However, more complex
recurrence objects can be constructed by combining multiple rschedules into
a \emph{recurrence bundle}.

There are three types of recurrence bundles provided in almanac, each of
which construct their event sets by performing a set operation on the
underlying event sets of the rschedules in the bundle.
\itemize{
\item \code{runion()} takes the union.
\item \code{rintersect()} takes the intersection.
\item \code{rsetdiff()} takes the set difference.
}

Once you have created a recurrence bundle, you can:
\itemize{
\item Add recurrence rules or other recurrence bundles with \code{\link[=add_rschedule]{add_rschedule()}}.
\item Forcibly include dates in its event set with \code{\link[=add_rdates]{add_rdates()}}.
\item Forcibly exclude dates from its event set with \code{\link[=add_exdates]{add_exdates()}}.
}
}
\details{
For \code{rsetdiff()}, the event set is created "from left to right" and depends
on the order that the rschedules were added to the bundle.

\examples{
runion()

on_weekends <- weekly() \%>\%
  recur_on_weekends()

runion() \%>\%
  add_rschedule(on_weekends)
