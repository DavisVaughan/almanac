Description: Provides tools for defining recurrence rules and recurrence
    bundles. Recurrence rules are a programatic way to define a recurring
    event, like "the first Monday of December". Multiple recurrence rules can
    be combined into larger recurrence bundles. Together, these provide a
    system for adjusting and generating sequences of dates while skipping over
    dates in event sets generated by recurrence bundles.
