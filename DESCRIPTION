Description: Provides tools for defining recurrence rules and recurrence
    sets. Recurrence rules are a programmatic way to define a recurring
    event, like the first Monday of December. Multiple recurrence rules
    can be combined into larger recurrence sets. A full holiday and
    calendar interface is also provided that can generate holidays within
    a particular year, can detect if a date is a holiday, can respect
    holiday observance rules, and allows for custom holidays.
